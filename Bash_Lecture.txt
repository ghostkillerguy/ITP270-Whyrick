Bash Scripting Tutorial

1. The beginning of your script file should start with:
	#!/bin/bash
	Explanation : This tells the computer which type of interpreter to use for the script.

2. To provide the script file an execute permission run below command:
	chmod +x fileName.sh

3. To run the script on terminal:
	./script.sh

4. To output message on terminal:
	echo "Message"

5. Variables: To set the variable 'greeting' to "Hello" string:
	greeting="Hello"
	**Don't put an extra space between the variable, "=" assignment operator and value

6. To access the value of variable, use the variable name prepended with a dollar sign
	echo $greeting

7. Conditionals: In bash we use if - then - else - fi for conditional
   Comparison Operators: 
	- Equal: -eq
	- Not equal: -ne
	- Less than or equal: -le
	- Less than: -lt
	- greater than or equal: -ge
	- Greater than: -gt
	- Is null: -z
  **When comparing strings, it is best practice to put variable into quotes("")
 
  A complete conditional in a bash scritp uses the foloowing syntax:
  
  # Declare the variable index and initialize it with zero
  $index=0
  if [ $index - lt 5 ]
  then 
    echo $index
  else
    echo 5
  fi

8. Loops: Three different types of loop - for, while, until

   For loop:
   
   for word in $paragraph
   do
     echo $word
   done   

   While loop:

   while [ $index -lt 5 ]
   do
     echo $index
     index=$((index + 1))
   done

   Until loop:

   until [$index -eq 5 ]
   do
    echo $index
    index=$((index + 1))
   done

9. Inputs: Keyword "read" then the variable to store the user input
   To store user input in the variable age the syntax should be like follwoing:
   read age

10. Adding an alias for customized script execution command and standard output:
    For example, we are trying to use "greet" to run script.sh and the standard input is going to be 3
    alias greet="./script.sh 3"
