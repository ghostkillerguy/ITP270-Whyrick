# First, letâ€™s sum up all the prices of haircuts. Create a variable total_price, and set it to 0.
# 2. Loop through the prices list and add each price to the variable
total_price = 0
for price in prices:
    total_price = price + total_price

# 3. After your loop, create a variable called average_price that is the total_price divided by the number of prices.
average_price = total_price / len(prices)

# 4. Print the value of average_price so the output looks like: Average Haircut Price: <average_price>
print(f'Average Haircut Price: {average_price:.2f}')
#5. Use a list comprehension to make a list called new_prices, which has each element in prices minus 5.
new_prices = [price -5 for price in prices]
# 6. Print new_prices.
print(f'New prices is : {new_prices}')
#7. Create a variable called total_revenue and set it to 0.
total_revenue = 0
# 8. Use a for loop to create a variable i that goes from 0 to len(hairstyles) Hint: You can use range() to do this!
for i in range(len(hairstyles)): 
#9. Add the product of prices[i]  last_week[i] (the number of people to total_revenue
    total_revenue = total_revenue + prices[i] * last_week[i]
# 10. After your loop, print the value of total_revenue, so the output looks like: Total Revenue: <total_revenue>
print(f'Total Revenue: {total_revenue}')
# 11. Find the average daily revenue by dividing total_revenue by 7. Call this number average_daily_revenue and print it out.
average_daily_revenue = total_revenue / 7
# copy line 26 and fix it up
print(f' Average Daily Price: {average_price:.2f}')

#12. Carly thinks she can bring in more customers by advertising all of the haircuts she has that are under 30 dollars. Use a list comprehension to create a list called cuts_under_30 that has the entry hairstyles[i] for each i for which new_prices[i] is less than 30. You can use range() in your list comprehension to make i go from 0 to len(new_prices) - 1.
cuts_under_30 = [hairstyles[i] for i in range(len(new_prices)) if new_prices[i] < 30]

#13. Print cuts_under_30.
print("Cuts under 30", cuts_under_30)
